## Definitions  
1. **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**:  
   AI systems that generate new data by pitting two networks (generator and discriminator) against each other.  
2. **Adversarial Autoencoders (AAEs)**:  
   A type of model combining autoencoders with adversarial training for generating data.  
3. **Variants**:  
   Different versions of GANs (e.g., cGAN, DCGAN).  
4. **Mode Collapse**:  
   A failure in GANs where the generator produces repetitive, non-diverse outputs.  
5. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**:  
   A statistical technique to find the parameters of a model that best match the real data.  
6. **Bayesian GAN**:  
   Incorporates Bayesian inference to improve GAN performance.

## Key Points  
1. **GAN Overview**:  
   - Adversarial learning framework with a **generator** and **discriminator** competing.  
   - Equilibrium is reached when neither can improve its task without hurting the other.  

2. **Variants of GANs**:  
   - **Conditional GANs (cGANs)**: Adds constraints to generate specific outputs.  
   - **Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs)**: Uses convolutional layers for better data generation (especially images).  

3. **Addressing Mode Collapse**:  
   - Mode collapse limits the diversity of generator outputs.  
   - Techniques to fix it include:  
     - **Minibatch GAN**: Adds batch-level information to improve diversity.  
     - **Unrolled GAN**: Considers multiple training steps for the generator.  
     - **Wasserstein GAN**: Stabilizes training with a new loss function.  

4. **MLE in GANs**:  
   - Goal: Match the generator's output distribution with the real data.  
   - Techniques include f-GAN, AVB, and Bayesian GAN.  

5. **Adversarial Autoencoders (AAEs)**:  
   - Combines **autoencoders** (compression and reconstruction) with adversarial learning.  
   - Helps generate robust and noise-resistant data representations.
